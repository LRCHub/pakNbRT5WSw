[00:08.23] Every time I think of you
[00:11.42] I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
[00:15.78] It's no problem of mine
[00:17.58] But it's a problem I find
[00:20.20] Living a life that I can't leave behind
[00:24.70] There's no sense in telling me
[00:27.67] The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
[00:31.94] But that's the way that it goes
[00:33.86] And it's what nobody knows
[00:36.42] Well every day my confusion grows
[00:52.92] 
[00:57.25] Every time I see you falling
[01:00.46] I get down on my knees and pray
[01:04.98] I'm waiting for that final moment
[01:08.68] You say the words that I can't say
[01:25.68] 
[01:30.27] I feel fine and I feel good
[01:32.97] I feel like I never should
[01:37.17] Whenever I get this way
[01:38.73] I just don't know what to say
[01:41.11] Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
[01:46.46] I'm not sure what this could mean
[01:48.84] I don't think you're what you seem
[01:53.19] I do admit to myself
[01:55.05] That if I hurt someone else
[01:56.60] Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
[02:20.10] 
[02:17.93] Every time I see you falling
[02:21.69] I get down on my knees and pray
[02:25.64] I'm waiting for that final moment
[02:29.68] You say the words that I can't say
[02:46.68] 
[02:34.76] Every time I see you falling
[02:38.14] I get down on my knees and pray
[02:42.17] I'm waiting for that final moment
[02:45.88] You say the words that I can't say
[03:02.88] 
[03:24.25] Every time I see you falling
[04:11.56] I get down on my knees and pray
[04:12.67] I'm waiting for that final moment
[04:13.75] You say the words that I can't say
[04:30.75] 
[04:14.56] Every time I see you falling
[04:14.73] I get down on my knees and pray
[04:15.39] I'm waiting for that final moment
[04:15.54] You say the words that I can't say
